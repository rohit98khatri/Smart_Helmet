📌 Project Overview
The Smart Helmet is an IoT-based safety system designed to enhance two-wheeler rider safety by ensuring helmet usage, preventing drunk driving, and providing real-time accident detection with automatic emergency alerts. The project integrates multiple sensors with a microcontroller to reduce road accidents and improve emergency response time.

🎯 Objectives
Ensure the rider is wearing a helmet before vehicle ignition
Prevent riding under the influence of alcohol
Detect accidents automatically
Send emergency alerts to predefined contacts

⚙️ Working Principle
Helmet Detection: An IR/pressure sensor checks whether the helmet is worn.
Alcohol Detection: MQ-3 sensor detects alcohol in the rider’s breath.
Ignition Control: Vehicle starts only if safety conditions are satisfied.
Accident Detection: Accelerometer/tilt sensor detects sudden impact or fall.
Emergency Alert: GSM module sends alert messages automatically.
